/**
 * Example RF Radio Ping Pair
 *
 * This is an example of how to use the RF24 class.  Write this sketch to two different nodes,
 * connect the role_pin to ground on one.  The ping node sends the current time to the pong node,
 * which responds by sending the value back.  The ping node can then see how long the whole cycle
 * took.

// in this system.  Doing so greatly simplifies testing.  The hardware itself specifies
